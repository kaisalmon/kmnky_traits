# Kai Monkey's Traits

A comprehensive mod (game modification) for [Stonehearth](https://store.steampowered.com/app/253250/Stonehearth/) that adds **nine unique character traits** to make each hearthling distinctive. Each character (hearthling) has between 1 and two traits, randomly selected from the pool.
This increases the pool of traits that make characters feel and play unique by 50%, from 21 to 30! 
Developed from **2018-2019**, this project involved working with the game's Lua scripting API, JSON data structures, and component systems to extend core gameplay mechanics.

*Game modding involves programming custom features and content that extend existing games beyond their original scope, requiring integration with existing codebases and APIs.*

## üéÆ Features

**Nine Brand New Character Traits:**
- **Barbarian** - Unique visual assets, modified combat stats, equipment restrictions via scripted logic

- **Pacifist** - Modified AI behavior trees for non-combat gameplay
- **Wizened** - Elder character mechanics with wisdom-based stat bonuses
- **Goblin** - Complete visual transformation system with model/texture swapping
